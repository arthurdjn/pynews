About
=====

This project concerns news article classification using Bag of Words (BoW). A feed forward neural network was
trained to predict one of the 20 sources. The **PyNews** package implemented in python was used to explore the
different possibilities and training hyper parameters, with the help of PyTorch.
We have trained and compared five different architectures on a training and development set. The main focus
of this report is to analyse the influence of the number of hidden layers on the modelâ€™s performance and time
efficiency.
From these different structures, we selected the best one and trained it three times and will be used to predict
unseen data.


Dependencies
============

**PyNews** was made in Python 3.7 and uses multiple machine learning libraries :

- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Pickle
- Time


Instalation
===========

To use this package, clone the repository at https://github.uio.no/arthurd/pynews on your laptop and from the root folder, 
run on the commandline :

``pip install .``

This will install the package in your python environment and download all the latest dependencies. You can know use and tweak the parameters of pynews' models.
